# turkishdatasetproject

In the folder are all of the items used.
  -There is a python script that I used to scrape and parse. Code for the main terminal to create HTML files is in this file.
  -The R script I used to get numbers for my poster presentation
  -The PDFs I scraped (these are from the Turkish Grand National Assembly website
  -The HTML files I generated
  -A very rough CSV
  
Note:
You will need to download pdfminer in order to run the code to make HTML files.
The CSV still needs to be cleaned, but this was the final version I made before completing my poster. Parsing function still needs work.

To-do:
  -upload final CSV file
